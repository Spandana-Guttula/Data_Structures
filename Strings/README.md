# STRINGS

## Description
C String is stored as an array of characters.
The difference between a character array and a C string is that the string in C is terminated with a unique character ‘\0’.
C strings Declaration types 
    i. character Arrays - String Literal without size( char str[] = " Geeksfor geeks" )
                        - String Literal with size (char str[50] = "GeeksforGeeks" )
                        - String character  by character with Size ( char str[14] = { 'G','e','e','k','s','f','o','r','G','e','e','k','s','\0'} )
                        - String character  by character without  Size (char str[] = { 'G','e','e','k','s','f','o','r','G','e','e','k','s','\0'})
    ii. Character Pointers - Directly assigned to pointer ( char *str  =  "GfG") ---> Stores in READ ONLY BLOCK 
                           -  dynamically alloacted ( char *str) ---> gets stored in heap
